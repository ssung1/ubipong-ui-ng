## Table Tennis Tournament Manager

This project is aimed at managing an on-site table tennis tournament.  Its goals are

- To be able to create player list and draws, for both single elimination and round robin.

- To be able to record scores, including

  - Normal completed games.
  - Defaults.
  - Double defaults.
  - Retirements.

- To be able to advance players according to the rules.

- To be able to display current playing status:

  - Summary of results, especially for a round robin.
  - Which players are due to play.

- To be able to enter results by players.  This is done through the use of
  challonge.com, which has a mobile application that allows players to enter
  scores.
